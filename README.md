#Insect Bite Classifier

This is a Streamlit app that uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify images of insect bites and skin conditions.
Features

Upload an image of a suspected insect bite or skin condition
The app will classify the image and display the predicted label and confidence level
Supported classes: ant bites, bed bugs, chiggers, fleas, mosquitos, no bites, spiders, and ticks
Includes a disclaimer to consult a medical professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment

Requirements

Python 3.7 or later
Streamlit
TensorFlow
Pillow (PIL)
NumPy

Installation

Clone the repository:

Copygit clone https://github.com/your-username/insect-bite-classifier.git

Install the required dependencies:

Copypip install streamlit tensorflow pillow numpy

Place your pre-trained model file (in H5 format) in the path/to/your/model.h5 location.
Run the Streamlit app:

Copystreamlit run app.py
The app should now be running on http://localhost:8501/.
Usage

Navigate to the web application in your browser.
Click the "Choose an image..." button to upload an image of a suspected insect bite or skin condition.
The app will classify the image and display the predicted label and confidence level.
The app includes a disclaimer to consult a medical professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

Limitations

This app uses a pre-trained model, which may not be able to accurately classify all types of insect bites or skin conditions.
The performance of the model may vary depending on the quality and diversity of the training data.
The app is not a substitute for professional medical advice and should not be used for self-diagnosis or treatment.

Future Improvements

Expand the list of supported classes to cover a wider range of insect bites and skin conditions.
Improve the model's accuracy and performance by fine-tuning or training a new model.
Implement additional features, such as the ability to save classified images or provide more detailed information about each condition.
Integrate the app with a medical database or API to provide more comprehensive information and guidance to users.

Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the need for a simple and accessible tool to help people identify and understand insect bites and skin conditions. The app uses a pre-trained deep learning model, and the developer would like to thank the researchers and engineers who contributed to the development of the underlying technology.
